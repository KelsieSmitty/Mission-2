    <br>
    <p>
        Peanut is a 9 year old Chocolate and White Cocker Spaniel. 
        This beautiful girl was bred in Christchurch and moved up 
        to Clevedon, Auckland as a puppy at 8 weeks old. 
        Her new forever home parents, Kelsie and Robbie, took her in, where she also
        met her new sister, Chocolah, a burmese cat.
        <br>
        <br>
        Peanut spent her early days playing with the other dogs and puppies at
        Clevedon, attending puppy school and falling asleep on the bed after day 2.
        At puppy school she was much less interested in playing with other dogs, but 
        escaping out of the little fences to go snuggle some humans and see if they 
        had any treats on offer. Her obedience was top tier, especially if cocktail
        sausages were involved, and she soon pogressed on to doing some agility
        when she got bigger and stronger.
        <br>
        <br>
        The rest of her adult days have involved taking over Kelsie and Robbie's bed,
        begging for food from her new little toddler humans, going for walkies and
        protecting the house from the passerbys that dare to walk past.
